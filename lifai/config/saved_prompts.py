After that, try plugging in and starting the system again.

The instructions to the customer: Do you have access to the Lenovo UEFI diagnostic tool?

If the issue persists, take a photo of the final result screen or record the code and date of completion before reverting back. The test typically takes about 5 minutes.

F10 diag = same as UEFI diag

UEFI diag full = same as above but instead of "QUICK UNATTENDED TEST" we want the customer to go for an "EXTENDED UNATTENDED TEST", this will take a few hours to complete but will be more in depth for detecting any underlying hardware error
